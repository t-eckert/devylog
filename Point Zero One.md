# Point Zero One

Devy is a platform for blogging using Markdown from a GitHub repository. I built it because I wanted to empower developers to share their ideas in an open format as easily as possible.

I believe a culture of writing and sharing ideas helps to shape the next generation of developers. We need spaces to extend and welcome in people. Writing is also a way for seasoned engineers to reify their knowledge and share their perspective.

My goal for this first chapter of Devy is to let anyone share their knowledge as easily as they push their code.
